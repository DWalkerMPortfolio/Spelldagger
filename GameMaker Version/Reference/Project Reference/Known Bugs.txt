- May be loading every sector twice (caused by lights marked as changed?)
- Guards walk through walls when failing to find a valid path
- Select does weird stuff with texture + deletes wrong instances
- Can't change layer sometimes (texture point number not properly set?)
- Export crashes sometimes (data issues?)
- Loading a distant sector (with farsight for example) unloads objects in the current sector
- Falling allows you to clip through walls
- Walls unload before lights, allowing lights to pass through walls at edge of screen
- Secret door visibility doesn't work properly
- Level editor crashes sometimes upon removing a path from an object
- Ladders are broken (particularly upwards ladders)
- Document UI stuck open when picking up document and key at same time
