- Langston:
	- Pair of guards in basement were tricky to get past
	- Accidentally opened secret door just by pressing interact
	- Interpreted hint about hearing where secret vault was by looking for sounds in the vault
	- Worried about using same solution to solve overcome all obstacles, need to require variety in approaches
