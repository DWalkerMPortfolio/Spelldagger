- Austin
	- Didn't read all the controls text
		- Didn't know how to fast-forward, intentionally rewind, or use runes
	- Repeatedly tried and failed to stun two-headed guard (which doesn't have a weak point)
	- Music is too loud to hear over speech in video
	- Tried to brute-force a lot of encounters (usually eventually succeeded)
		- Need harder barriers (make very clear when something won't work). Or make guards less of an obstacle
	- Tried to have carrier guard block lasers (should that work?)
	- Frequently hit camera weak point trigger but dagger fell out of it because it didn't stick to the wall
	- Encountered bug where guards stayed stunned
- Langston:
	- Too easy to slip past basic guards in hallways
	- Guards turning to face you instantly while alerted is bad
	- Came back to play again, removing a different set of abilities this time
- Dani:
	- Didn't use distraction
	- Wanted to see more open spaces that require you to get past multiple sets of guards in one go
	- Was really excited by possibilities of daggers
	- Wanted to see rewind clock synchronized with in-game time
	- Wanted a map to annotate
	- Camera got stuck stunned and dagger detector got stuck detecting dagger
	- Control scheme was unintuitive, too much time searching for correct button
	- Suggested anti-magic fields that
	- Really enjoyed moment-to-moment gameplay
	- Got soft-locked by dying immediately after teleporter cleared rewind history
